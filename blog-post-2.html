                    <p>Software development is moving faster than ever, and keeping up without losing quality is a real challenge. As projects grow, managing changes and ensuring everything works as expected becomes harder. That’s where Continuous Integration (CI) with Azure Pipelines helps. It automatically builds and tests your code every time there’s a change, so you can catch issues early and keep your development process running smoothly.</p>

                    <h3>What is Azure Pipelines?</h3>
                    <p>Azure Pipelines is a cloud-based service from Microsoft that automates your software delivery process. It builds, tests, and deploys your code every time you make a change, helping you catch problems early and speed up development. Key benefits include support for Linux, macOS, and Windows, CI/CD as code using YAML, and easy integration with GitHub and Azure Repos.</p>

                    <h3>How CI/CD Works in Azure Pipelines</h3>
                    <p>The CI/CD process begins when a developer commits code, which triggers a build pipeline. This pipeline compiles the code, runs unit tests, and creates build artifacts. Once successful, these artifacts are stored and a release pipeline is triggered, which deploys the application across different environments like Development, Staging, and Production.</p>

                    <h3>Core Components of Azure Pipelines</h3>
                    <p>To make CI/CD work smoothly, it’s important to understand the fundamental building blocks:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Stages, Jobs & Steps:</strong> A hierarchy for organizing your workflow into logical groups like Build, Test, or Deploy.</li>
                        <li><strong>Agent Pools:</strong> The compute infrastructure (VMs) where jobs run, either Microsoft-hosted or self-hosted for custom needs.</li>
                        <li><strong>Triggers:</strong> Rules that define when a pipeline should run, such as on a code commit (Push Trigger) or pull request.</li>
                        <li><strong>Variables:</strong> Reusable placeholders for values like environment names or version numbers.</li>
                        <li><strong>Artifacts:</strong> The output of your build process, like binaries or Docker images, passed to the release pipeline.</li>
                        <li><strong>Service Connections:</strong> Secure links to external services like Azure subscriptions, GitHub, or Docker Hub.</li>
                        <li><strong>Environments:</strong> Representations of your deployment targets (e.g., Dev, QA, Prod) that help track deployments and enforce policies.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Getting Started: CI Setup with YAML</h3>
                    <p>Setting up CI with YAML provides a version-controlled, code-based approach to defining your pipelines.</p>
                    <h4>Step 1: Define Triggers, Agents, and Variables</h4>
                    <p>Your YAML file starts by defining when the pipeline runs, what kind of machine it runs on, and any reusable variables.</p>
<pre class="code-block"><code># Trigger on changes to main or develop branches
trigger:
  branches:
    include:
    - main
    - develop

# Use a Microsoft-hosted agent
pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

# Define variables for reuse
variables:
  buildConfiguration: 'Release'
  dotNetFramework: 'net6.0'</code></pre>
                    
                    <h4>Step 2: Add Build and Deploy Stages</h4>
                    <p>Next, define the stages for building, testing, and deploying your application. The `Build` stage compiles the code and runs unit tests, while the `Deploy` stage pushes the artifacts to a service like Azure Web App.</p>
<pre class="code-block"><code>stages:
- stage: Build
  displayName: 'Build Stage'
  jobs:
  - job: BuildJob
    steps:
    - task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
      displayName: 'Build application'
      inputs:
        command: 'build'
        projects: '**/*.csproj'
        arguments: '--configuration $(buildConfiguration)'
    
    - task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
      displayName: 'Run unit tests'
      inputs:
        command: 'test'
        projects: '**/*Tests/*.csproj'

- stage: Deploy
  displayName: 'Deploy Stage'
  dependsOn: Build
  condition: succeeded()
  jobs:
  - deployment: DeployWeb
    environment: 'production'
    strategy:
      runOnce:
        deploy:
          steps:
          - task: AzureWebApp@1
            displayName: 'Deploy to Azure Web App'
            inputs:
              azureSubscription: 'your-service-connection'
              appName: 'your-web-app-name'
              package: '$(Pipeline.Workspace)/**/*.zip'</code></pre>

                    <h3>How to Keep Pipeline Costs in Check</h3>
                    <p>As your usage grows, it’s smart to optimize for cost and performance. Here are some best practices:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Agent Usage:</strong> Use Microsoft-hosted agents efficiently, and consider self-hosted agents for frequent or resource-heavy workloads to save on long-term costs.</li>
                        <li><strong>Pipeline Efficiency:</strong> Use shallow clones to reduce fetch time, and cache dependencies to avoid downloading the same packages in every run.</li>
                        <li><strong>Conditional Execution:</strong> Apply conditions (`condition: succeeded()`) to skip unnecessary stages or jobs, saving runtime and resources.</li>
                    </ul>
